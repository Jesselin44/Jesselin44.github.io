    <h2 class="display-6">HOBBIES</h2>
    <p>I've had multiple hobbies growing up, I did soccer, martial arts,
      basketball, fishing, very little volley ball and badminton, and the last 2 things
      I really committed to after leaving highschool was Bowling and weight lifting. My older
      brothers were in leagues, cheering them on was always so much fun, so I gave it
      a try. Althought I never joined a professional league, I did get my own custom bowling ball.
      Every now and then I still go and average about a 210 score. I also did in fact fall in love
      with Weighlifting. I did also do it for some time in highscool. A coach within the school was very 
      supportive and pushed many of us to our limits. My most favorite thing was deadlifitng!! Fishing has always
      been very amusing to me, I consider myself a very patient person. The two fishes I really enjoy eating is Flounder and striped bass.
